# Part 1: Debugging Scenario

# Student's EdStem post:

**What environment are you using (computer, operating system, web browser, terminal/editor, and so on)?**

I am on a Mac using Linux, and Chrome as my browser. VS code for the editor, and GitHub to save my code. 



**Detail the symptom you're seeing. Be specific; include both what you're seeing and what you expected to see instead. 
Screenshots are great, copy-pasted terminal output is also great. Avoid saying “it doesn't work”.**

I am having trouble with a test for my filter method. The symptom given by the terminal output is an assertion error. 
It says the expected output is: <[a, a]> but the actual was <[a]> and I don't understand why. My best guess is there is 
something wrong with the test



**Detail the failure-inducing input and context. That might mean any or all of the command you're running, a test case, 
command-line arguments, working directory, even the last few commands you ran. Do your best to provide as much context as you can.**
