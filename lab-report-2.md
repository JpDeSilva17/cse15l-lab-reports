# Lab Report 2

The first step is to go back to the lab we did on week 2 and refresh our memories on how the ```URLHandler Inteface``` works. In our case 
we are going to use ```StringServer``` in a similar way to how we used ```NumberServer``` in the lab. ```StringServer.java``` is a program with a ```main``` method that creates a ```URLHandler``` and uses ```Server.java``` to start a web server using that handler.
